About the glee


With the current situation in the world, we will often have to stay home. for those of us who work outside the home, spending time at home can be like being in a prison cell. we need to spend our days without stress and without wasting time. many people are accustomed to using social media. we think it is monotonous. as a solution, we thought of filling many different things in one place.
We want to create a website by adding several things. That's called Glee. the main purpose of this is to spend time without wasting time and thereby develop people's imagination in some way. it includes several elements.


1.music
one aspect here is the music., If someone loves it, this is more for him. Here you can be listing to the song, you can create covers and upload them, you can submit your own songs reviews, and also you can ask other people about them, you can create and publish new songs in this area. This gives the opportunity to do things like this.

2. Games
Someone may dislike music and be bored when one is continuously in it. Then they can focus on these games aspects. Here he or she can play different people and get rid of monotony


3.E-Books
Some people are very interested in reading. But with the epidemic situation, it is not practical for them to go to libraries. This is a great opportunity for them. Maybe they can move on to another aspect if it gets boring.
